## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/robertolupini-9247s-projects/v0-ai-wellness](https://vercel.com/robertolupini-9247s-projects/v0-ai-wellness)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/projects/TLOvidmys6i](https://v0.app/chat/projects/TLOvidmys6i)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository

## Development

### Testing Mode

To skip the onboarding and welcome screens during development for easier testing, set the following environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_ONBOARDING=true
```

This will automatically skip the welcome page and user registration flow, taking you directly to the main health dashboard.
